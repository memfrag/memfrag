### Hello, my name is Martin

In my spare time, I mostly contribute code to the public repositories in the account of our hobby company Apparata [github/apparata](https://github.com/apparata). If you're looking for recent code I've written, I would suggest you start there. The public repositories in this personal account are rather stale.
